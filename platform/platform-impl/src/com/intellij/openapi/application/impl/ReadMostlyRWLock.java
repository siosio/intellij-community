/**
 * Read-Write lock optimised for mostly reads.
 * Scales better than {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock} with a number of readers due to reduced contention thanks to thread local structures.
 * The lock has writer preference, i.e. no reader can obtain read lock while there is a writer pending.
 * NOT reentrant.
 * Writer assumed to issue write requests from the dedicated thread {@link #writeThread} only.
 * Readers must not issue read requests from the write thread {@link #writeThread}.
 * <br>
 * Based on paper <a href="http://mcg.cs.tau.ac.il/papers/ppopp2013-rwlocks.pdf">"NUMA-Aware Reader-Writer Locks" by Calciu, Dice, Lev, Luchangco, Marathe, Shavit.</a><br>
 * The elevator pitch explanation of the algorithm:<br>
 * Read lock: flips {@link Reader#readRequested} bit in its own thread local {@link Reader} structure and waits for writer to release its lock by checking {@link #writeRequested}.<br>
 * Write lock: sets global {@link #writeRequested} bit and waits for all readers (in global {@link #readers} list) to release their locks by checking {@link Reader#readRequested} for all readers.
